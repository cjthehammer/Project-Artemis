Project-Artemis
===============
Project Artemis is the WIP name for an in-progress 2D free roaming action RPG.
The game will feature a homemade engine and will focus around creating a living, breathing world where the player can make their experience unique.
Randomized items and customizable skills will allow the player to find the playstyle they enjoy best, while keeping the gameplay skill based.
The open world will feature major factions along with randomized clans that will fight and trade with each other without any player interaction, but will react to player involvement.
The player can affect whole wars by helping sides, or make their own stake in the world by raiding a fortress and taking it for themselves, opening a whole new responsiblity of managing not only a castle, but a whole faction. Wage wars, trade, and master diplomacy to stay alive.
The game will be a sidescrolling 2.5D game that is voxel based and can allow for strategic world destruction. For example, small arms fire won't get you anywhere but a well placed grenade or rocket will blow a hole through the object you are trying to get through. High explosives will allow you to build tunnels that can serve to a large tactical advantage, but are expensive and dangerous.
The game will be set in a futuristic fantasy world with everything from swords to railguns, but will also feature wildlife.
